		Hello Web
	</h1>

	<ol>
		<li>
			Check out the <a
			href="https://github.com/shuntress/web-host/tree/main/administration/setup">setup
			scripts</a> (if you haven't already) and configure your system to run this as a
			persistent service.
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Configure your router to pass traffic
				on ports 80 and 443 to the machine running
				your web site.
				<span class="note">
					(Probably 192.168.1.1 with credentials
					on a sticker. Look for firewall or port-forwarding rules.)<span>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Setup login requirements for any content you don't want to share publicly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anything with <strong>private</strong> in the URL will require a login.
			</p>
			<p>
				Any directory containing a file named <strong>.authorized_users</strong> will require the logged in user's name to be included in the (newline-separated) list of users allowed to view anything in that directory (recursive).
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Create and account
			</p>
			<p>
			<pre><kbd>https://[yourip]/account</kbd></pre>
			This form will add a username, password hash, and salt to
			<pre><kbd>administration/account_creation_requests.txt</kbd></pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				Move the line for the account(s) you wish to create from there to
			<pre><kbd>administration/user_credentials.txt</kbd></pre> (create this file if it does not exist)
			</p>
			<p>
				restart the server to load new user accounts.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			Check if things are working with:
			<pre><kbd>http://[yourip]/status</kbd></pre>
			or
			<pre><kbd>https://[yourip]/private/status</kbd></pre>
			if you have enabled HTTPS.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>
		Server-Side Code for Dynamic Content
	</h2>
	<p>
		Adding server-side code
		is a little more complicated than static content.
	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="https://github.com/shuntress/web-host/blob/master/src/route.js">route.js</a> handles
		scanning for plugin modules when the service starts.
	</p>
	<p> A "plugin module" (or "controller") is any .js file in the web-host/plugin directory.
		Plugins found in this scan will be called when the server receives a request
		where the path matches down to an exported function.
	</p>
	<p>
		https://{yourdomain}/{path}/{to}/{plugin}/{plugin name}/{function on module.exports}
	</p>

	<h2 class="note">
		Additional Notes
	</h2>
	<ol class="notes">
		<li>
			<p>
				The basic auth credentials,
				certificate, and secret key are in web-host/administration/ and
				noted in .gitignore to help prevent them being
				accidentally included in source control
				management history.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			Long-term logging will depend on the system-specific installation but logs are duplicated to a rolling daily log file in the administration directory.
		</li>
